**CleanDiffuser** is an easy-to-use modularized Diffusion Model library tailored for decision-making, which comprehensively integrates different types of diffusion algorithmic branches. CleanDiffuser offers a variety of advanced *diffusion models*, *network structures*, diverse *conditions*, and *algorithm pipelines* in a simple and user-friendly manner. Inheriting the design philosophy of [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) and [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), CleanDiffuser emphasizes **usability, simplicity, and customizability**. We hope that CleanDiffuser will serve as a foundational tool library, providing long-term support for Diffusion Model research in the decision-making community, facilitating the application of research for scientists and practitioners alike. The highlight features of CleanDiffuser are:

- üöÄ Amazing features specially tailored for decision-making tasks
- üçß Support for multiple advanced diffusion models and network architectures
- üß© Build decoupled modules into integrated pipelines easily like building blocks
- üìà Wandb logging and Hydra configuration
- üåè Unified environmental interface and efficient dataloader

We strongly recommend reading [papers]() and [documents](https://cleandiffuserteam.github.io/CleanDiffuserDocs/) to learn more about CleanDiffuser and its design philosophy.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

We recommend installing and experiencing CleanDiffuser through a Conda virtual environment.

First, install the dependencies related to the mujoco-py environment. For more details, see https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco

```bash
apt-get install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 patchelf
```

Download CleanDiffuser and add this folder to your PYTHONPATH. You can also add it to .bashrc for convenience:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CleanDiffuserTeam/CleanDiffuser.git
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/CleanDiffuser
```

Install the Conda virtual environment and PyTorch:
```bash
conda create -n cleandiffuser python==3.9
conda activate cleandiffuser
# pytorch
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
# pytorch3d
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
pip install --no-index --no-cache-dir pytorch3d -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pytorch3d/packaging/wheels/py39_cu113_pyt1121/download.html
```

Install the remaining dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you need to run D4RL-related environments, install D4RL additionally:
pip install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl@master#egg=d4rl
```

If you need to reproduce imitation learning related environments (PushT, Kitchen, Robomimic), you need to download the datasets additionally. We recommend downloading the corresponding compressed files from [Datasets](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/data/training/). We provide the default dataset path as `dev/`:

```bash
dev/
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kitchen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pusht_cchi_v7_replay.zarr
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robomimic
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## üíª Usage

The `cleandiffuser` folder contains the core components of the CleanDiffuser codebase, including `Diffusion Models`, `Network Architectures`, and `Guided Sampling`. It also provides unified `Env and Dataset Interfaces`.

In the `tutorials` folder, we provide the simplest runnable tutorials and algorithms, which can be understood in conjunction with the documentation.

<!-- ```bash
# Build the DiffusionBC algorithm with minimal code
python tutorials/1_a_minimal_DBC_implementation.py
# Construct a Diffusion Model without guidance
python tutorials/2_classifier-free_guidance.py
# Construct a Diffusion Model with guidance
python tutorials/3_classifier_guidance
# Apply your customized Diffusion Model
python tutorials/4_customize_your_diffusion_network_backbone
``` -->

In CleanDiffuser, we can combine independent modules to algorithms pipelines like building blocks. In the `pipelines` folder, we provide all the algorithms currently implemented in CleanDiffuser. By linking with the Hydra configurations in the `configs` folder, you can reproduce the results presented in the papers:

You can simply run each algorithm with the default environment and configuration without any additional setup, for example:

```bash
# DiffusionPolicy with Chi_UNet in lift-ph
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py
# Diffuser in halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py
```

Thanks to Hydra, CleanDiffuser also supports flexible running of algorithms through CLI or directly modifying the corresponding configuration files. We provide some examples:

```bash
# Load PushT config
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py --config-path=../configs/dp/pusht/dit --config-name=pusht
# Load PushT config and overwrite some hyperparameters
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py --config-path=../configs/dp/pusht/dit --config-name=pusht dataset_path=path/to/dataset seed=42 device=cuda:1
# Train Diffuser in hopper-medium-v2 task
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py task=hopper-medium-v2 
```

In CleanDiffuser, we provide a mode option to switch between **training** `(mode=train)` or **inference** `(mode=inference)` of the model:

```bash
# Imitation learning environment
python pipelines/dp_pusht.py mode=inference model_path=path/to/checkpoint
# Reinforcement learning environment
python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py mode=inference ckpt=latest
```
